This is a python script which downloads all the resources from our class's Computer Networks website : http://ise.pesit.pes.edu/ISE/2013-CS301/

On running this script, it creates a folder "CompNwks" in the same directory as the script, and downloads all folders present in the website. If all the files are already downloaded, then on running the script, those files are downloaded only if they are modified otherwise they are not downloaded.
